# FreelanceFlowGemini2

Roadmap to Production
Step 1: Separate the Frontend & Backend
We will split the project into two separate codebases:

Frontend (React App): This is our existing freelanceflow.jsx file, which will be broken down into smaller, manageable component files (ProjectView.jsx, KanbanBoard.jsx, etc.). Its job is to look great and manage user interactions.

Backend (API Server): A new project built with Node.js and Express.js (as per your original tech stack). Its job is to handle all data, logic, and security.

Step 2: Build the Backend API
The backend server will expose an API (Application Programming Interface), which is a set of URLs the frontend can call to request or send data.

**Progress:**
- **Done:**
  - Initial Node.js/Express server setup.
  - API routes created for `/projects`, `/clients`, and `/auth`.
  - Switched to SQLite for local development.
  - Implemented basic password hashing with `bcryptjs`.

- **Next:**
  - Resolve the database connectivity issue preventing API testing.
  - Fully test all API endpoints.
  - Implement JWT-based authentication (token generation and validation).
  - Finalize database choice and connect to a production PostgreSQL (or other) database.

Technology: We'll use Node.js, Express.js for the server framework, and PostgreSQL as the database for storing all the data.

Endpoints: We will create endpoints for every action a user can take:

POST /api/projects - Create a new project.

GET /api/projects - Get a list of all projects.

PUT /api/projects/:id - Update a specific project.

DELETE /api/projects/:id - Delete a project.

...and so on for clients, tasks, invoices, and expenses.

Step 3: Connect the Frontend to the API
This is where we replace our mock data. Instead of using useState with initialProjects, we will use the fetch API to talk to our backend.

Example: Before
const [projects, setProjects] = useState(initialProjects);

Example: After

JavaScript

const [projects, setProjects] = useState([]);

useEffect(() => {
  // Fetch projects from our new backend when the component loads
  fetch('/api/projects')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setProjects(data));
}, []);
We'll use a state management library like React Query or Zustand to make this data fetching clean, efficient, and handle loading/error states.

Step 4: Implement Real Authentication & Security
The backend will manage user accounts.

When a user signs up, the backend will securely hash their password and save it in the database.

When they log in, the backend will verify their credentials and send back a secure JWT (JSON Web Token).

The frontend will store this token and include it in every future API request to prove who the user is.

The backend will check this token on every request to ensure a user can only access their own data.

Step 5: Integrate Stripe for Subscriptions
This is a backend-heavy task.

The frontend will have a "Subscribe" button.

When clicked, it will tell the backend, "This user wants to subscribe."

The backend will then securely communicate with Stripe's API to create a subscription and a payment session.

The backend sends a unique Stripe session URL back to the frontend, which redirects the user to the secure Stripe payment page.

Stripe handles all the credit card information, so our app remains secure and PCI compliant.

Step 6: Deployment
Finally, we'll put our app on the internet.

Frontend Hosting: We'll deploy our React application to a service like Vercel or Netlify.

Backend Hosting: The Node.js API server and PostgreSQL database will be deployed to a service like Render, Fly.io, or AWS.
